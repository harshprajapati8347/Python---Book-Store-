# Python Programming Assignment to Create Book Store

The goal of the assignment is to write some software that would assist in the tracking of stock in a bookstore. The data will be entered, processed and then ultimately analysed.
The assignment will get progressively more complex as it proceeds - the early stages will be reasonably straight forward and will be sufficient for a passing grade, and the more advanced stages are for those who wish to go further and target a higher overall result. As a general rule, to pass you will need to complete Stage 1, Stage 2 & Stage 3.  Completing Stage 4 should gain a High Distinction, noting
that we will be considering commenting and how well it meets the specifications in determining the grade.
